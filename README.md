# TestMapService
SAMPLE PROJECT TO UPDATE GOOGLE MAP LOCATION FROM A BACKGROUND SERVICE USING GPS

Based on Hiep Mai Thanh's youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCZPUeY94MU), 

and javapapers.com's fused location provider API tutorial (http://javapapers.com/android/android-location-fused-provider/). This page doesn't look like working now, but you can follow this link http://www.askfortricks.com/2016/03/get-location-in-android-using-fusedlocationprovider-api-or-make-android-app-location-aware/

Hiep Mai Thanh's direction finder files are included in Direction package. Comments are included to make it somewhat readable.

<b>PLEASE CONSIDER USING YOUR OWN MAPS API KEY</b>, and dont forget to enable directions api (To do that follow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCZPUeY94MU&feature=youtu.be&t=11m48s)


A sample apk is added (TestMapService.apk : Just to make sure it works)
